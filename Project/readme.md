# 1.Which version Visual Studio and Operating System you used to test/write the code  locally? 

1. **Visual Studio:**
   - Visual Studio Community 2022
   
2. **Operating System:**
   - Windows 10 professional edition

# 2.How does it work?  How does your code fit together and how should a programmer navigate it (not intended to be an exercise in formally documenting the code)?

1. This program combines various graphic rendering techniques, including Phong lighting models, multi light processing, texture sampling, transparency processing, normal mapping, and sky box rendering, to create a scene with animation and lighting effects, such as simulating the effect of microwave oven lighting. The structure of a program and how its various parts work together are crucial for programmers.
   

# 3.Anything else which will help us to understand how your prototype works.

1. **The operation of the program:**
   - Extract Opengl.zip to this path: C: \ Users \ Public \ OpenGL. Then you can run this program in Visual Studio.

2. **Operation method:**
   - You can turn on the light source in the microwave by clicking the left mouse button, and turn off the light source by clicking the right mouse button.
